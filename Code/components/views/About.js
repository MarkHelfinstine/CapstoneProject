        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Project Echelon equips and empowers veterans to experience life in a
          new, healthy way by helping them develop their emotional intelligence
          and connecting them with a physical challenge. As veterans grow
          stronger both mentally and physically, we continue to foster their
          desire to become visible and known. Ultimately we understand that
          healing is a journey and we are honored to play a role in supporting
          our nation's heroes as they strive to be successful in all areas of
          their life.

          Biking is one way to combat depression, anxiety, or even PTSD.
          Physical activity is one of the best interventions someone can do if
          they're struggling with their life, health, or wellness. A bike is a
          tool which represents the momentum we must generate by pedaling and
          making the wheels turn. Pedaling can be hard, especially when climbing
          a hill, but it's the only way to make this tool work properly so you
          can get from where you are to where you want to go. We must pedal to
          generate hope, cultivate strength, and move forward in life. Not just
          for ourselves, but also for our families and community.

        <h3>Project Echelon Racing Team</h3>
        <p>
          The Project Echelon Racing Team could easily be described as the most
          successful cycling team in all disciplines in the United States.
          During the 2022 season the Criterium squad dominated. They had
          excellent results at major road races in the United States and had
          podium finishes at Pro and Amateur Pro Nationals as well. With regards
          to the Time Trial, no team has more consistent podium finishes than
          Project Echelon Racing Team. Exciting news for the 2023 season is that
          the team has been granted UCI Continental status. This allows them to
          race at the highest level in Europe and elsewhere. They achieved
          amazing results at Mallorca, Spain this winter with Matt Zimmer
          snagging the KOM (king of the mountain) award on the first day of
          racing. This is an incredible accomplishment for a brand new UCI
          Continental team to achieve at this level. Former world champions were
          present and other World Tour riders as well.
