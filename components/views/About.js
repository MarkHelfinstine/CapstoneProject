      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Project Echelon equips and empowers veterans to experience life in a
        new, healthy way by helping them develop their emotional intelligence
        and connecting them with a physical challenge. As veterans grow stronger
        both mentally and physically, we continue to foster their desire to
        become visible and known. Ultimately we understand that healing is a
        journey and we are honored to play a role in supporting our nation's
        heroes as they strive to be successful in all areas of their life.

        Biking is one way to combat depression, anxiety, or even PTSD. Physical
        activity is one of the best interventions someone can do if they're
        struggling with their life, health, or wellness. A bike is a tool which
        represents the momentum we must generate by pedaling and making the
        wheels turn. Pedaling can be hard, especially when climbing a hill, but
        it's the only way to make this tool work properly so you can get from
        where you are to where you want to go. We must pedal to generate hope,
        cultivate strength, and move forward in life. Not just for ourselves,
        but also for our families and community.

      <h3>Fundraiser Information</h3>
      <p>
        The Everest Challenge is historically completed by climbing
        approximately 29,030 ft on the bike in a single attempt and without
        stopping. This is a monumental physical feat and takes a good majority
        of a single day to complete, often leaving the athlete extremely
        drained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Everest Challenge is symbolic of the suffering endured by military
        service members both present and past. The average rate of Veteran
        suicide is 22 per day. This challenge is a way to take on a small amount
        of suffering and to bring awareness to this problem.
      </p>

        The Project Echelon Everest Challenge of 2023 will be conducted a little
        bit differently. Instead of enforcing the traditional single activity
        rule, this challenge will be held over the course of 1 month. The
        accumulated elevation gain of either real life or virtual activities
        will be tracked in real time as each activity is uploaded.
