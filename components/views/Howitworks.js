      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>Instructions</p>
      <p>
        The first step will be to create an account on Strava. Strava is a free
        fitness-focused social media platform which allows athletes to track
        their physical activities and also view various metrics such as heart
        rate, speed, distance, elevation, etc. Once the Strava profile is
        created the challenger will need to join the Project Echelon club. This
        is how the challenge will be tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complete the form on the Signup page to register for the challenge.
        Because there are so many athletes on that club who are not registered
        this is how we'll be able to track activites for those participating in
        this challenge.
      </p>

        The rules are simple. First challenger to reach 29,030ft in elevation
        gain over the course of the month will be the winner. This is no easy
        task and will require dedication and disciplined efforts to complete the
        challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether the challenger completes the goal or not, they can rest easy
        knowing that they endured just a little bit of suffering compared to
        those service members who face it every single day. It will be worth it.
      </p>

        Join us as we come together in a fun way. Again, it's important to
        recognize the problem of veteran suicide today and bring awareness to
        this problem. Spread the word. Get your friends, family, and coworkers
        to participate and contribute.

        Though donations are not required they are certainly appreciated. A good
        recommendation would be to request donations for every 100 ft climbed.
        Climbing 100ft on a bike will make anybody sweat at least a little and
        is a good place to start.
